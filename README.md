# Project Name
 Weekend React Gallery

## Description
In this project, I was tasked with creating a gallery that would show photos using React. When you click on the photo, it would change to show a description of the photo clicked. A button should've also been displayed under each photo and when clicked, it would change the number of likes cooresponding to that whoto and save it in the database. Lastly, the number of likes for each photo should be displayed under the like button. 

Some of the challenges I faced with this project include: having the description displayed in a container that matched the size and position of the photo container; working with react to change css properties with reactjs; and generaly I had a bit of trouble working with a relativly new language. 

## Lastly...

Just wanted to give a shout out to Koffi for helping me with some of the troubles I had, specifically regarding passing props properly.
